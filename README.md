# README

This README provides instructions for running a Flask application by activating a virtual environment (venv) and downloading its requirements.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed on your system
- pip package manager installed

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Flask App

6. **Set Environment Variables (if applicable)**:
   - If your Flask application requires any environment variables to run (e.g., database URI, API keys), set them accordingly. You can usually do this in a `.env` file or directly in your terminal session.

7. **Run the Flask App**:
   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

   This command will start the Flask development server, and you should see output indicating the server is running. By default, the server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

8. **Access the App**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or whatever address/port your Flask app is configured to run on). You should see your Flask application up and running.

## Additional Notes

- **Debug Mode**:
  By default, Flask runs in debug mode. This means that the server will automatically reload when changes are made to the code. To disable debug mode, set the `FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable to `0` before running the app.

- **Deployment**:
  For production deployment, it's recommended to use a WSGI server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI in conjunction with a reverse proxy server like Nginx.

- **Security**:
  Ensure that your Flask application follows security best practices, especially if deploying it to a production environment. This includes securing sensitive information, validating input, and protecting against common web vulnerabilities.

- **Documentation**:
  Refer to Flask's official documentation for more advanced usage and customization options: [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

That's it! You've successfully set up and run a Flask application using a virtual environment. If you encounter any issues, refer to Flask's documentation or seek help from the Flask community.

You can use this Markdown code to create a README.md file for your Flask application, which will render nicely on platforms supporting Markdown formatting.
